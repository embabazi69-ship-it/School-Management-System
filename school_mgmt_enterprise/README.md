# SchoolEase — Production-ready School Management (Starter)

This repository is an upgraded, production-oriented starter for a School Management System.
It includes:

- Flask backend with user auth and CRUD (students/teachers/courses)
- Postgres support (production DB)
- Sentry integration (optional)
- Stripe placeholder for payments
- Docker + nginx reverse proxy + docker-compose.prod
- GitHub Actions CI (tests, build, push) and example Render deploy step
- Demo data script and marketing landing page

---

## Quick local dev (docker-compose)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit as needed.
2. Start (development):
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
   ```
   - Visit `http://localhost` (nginx fronting the app)

## Recommended production hosts
- **Render** — easy Docker/Git-based deploys and automatic HTTPS. See Render docs for Docker deploys. citeturn0search0turn1search12
- **Fly.io** — lightweight global apps from Docker images; great for low-latency. citeturn0search1turn0search5
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** — container and App Platform support with GitHub integration. citeturn0search2turn0search11
- **Railway** — simple Dockerfile-based deploys; good developer experience. citeturn0search3

If you run your own VPS, use Nginx + Certbot (Let's Encrypt) to obtain TLS certificates. citeturn1search0

## Production checklist (short)
- Replace secrets (SECRET_KEY, DB password) and store them in your host's secret manager.
- Use a managed Postgres instance for reliability.
- Enable Sentry (set SENTRY_DSN) for error monitoring. citeturn1search1
- Add backups and regular DB dumps.
- Configure a payment provider (Stripe/Paystack) and test payments.
- Set up CI/CD using the provided GitHub Actions workflow.
- Enable automatic HTTPS via your host (Render/Fly) or Certbot on VPS. citeturn1search12turn0search5

## CI/CD & Deploy (example using Render)
1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. Create a Render Web Service and connect your GitHub repo, or use the Render deploy action in the provided workflow.
3. Set environment variables in Render (SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, SENTRY_DSN, STRIPE_*).
4. Trigger deploys by pushing to `main`. Render supports auto-deploys on push. citeturn1search12

## If you use a VPS (Ubuntu) — TLS with Certbot
Follow Certbot + Nginx steps to obtain and auto-renew certificates. Example guide: DigitalOcean's Certbot + Nginx tutorial. citeturn1search0

## Next steps I recommend (marketing & product)
1. Replace the demo UI with a modern React/Vite frontend (single page app) and a polished UI kit.
2. Add parent portal + notifications (email & SMS integration like Twilio or local SMS provider).
3. Add fee/payment workflows + receipts (Stripe or local provider).
4. Add onboarding flows, sample data, and a demo user credentials page for sales.
5. Add analytics (Google Analytics or privacy-friendly Matomo) on the marketing site.
6. Create a 1-page landing with pricing and a signup form — connect to Stripe for paid trials.
